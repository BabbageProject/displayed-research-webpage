      <p>Charles Babbage's Difference Engine was said to have influenced the modern computer as we know it today.
        It was the first of its kind; a calculating mechanism capable of a precision of up to 20 decimal places.
        At the time, the people tasked with working out these advanced sums (and occasionally getting answers wrong) were called 'Computers',
        which is a rather interesting notion - in comparison to what we think of when we hear 'computer' today.
