    <p><i>The <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/222867128/">Scratch</a> project below is a prototype simulation of the Difference Engine - a fun introduction, aimed at younger learners to educate them about its function.</i></p>

    <p>The engine itself was actually only capable of addition and subtraction, as mentioned <a href="inf.html">here</a>. But I decided  to expand my simulation to be capable of all four basic mathematical operations.</p>

  <div class="paragraph-right">
    <p>I can't pretend to understand the Method Of Finite Differences, but from what I have researched - I gather that if you know the digits at certain places in a polynomial, you can calculate the full answer. <i>(This may be incorrect, I'm not certain. **It's A Level Maths; I've tried.)</i></p>
    <p>However, I <b>do</b> know for certain that the way the engine functions is through the Method Of Finite Differences, and there is a helpful youtube video below, explaining how to put the method to use.
